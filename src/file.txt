"I'm really struggling to understand why you're being so vague about your daily routine. Can you walk me through your typical day, step by step?"
"I'm really trying to get a sense of your daily workflow, and I'm having a hard time piecing together a clear picture. Can you help me out by walking me through what a typical day looks like for you, from start to finish?"
"I'd love to help clarify that for you. Can you help me out by walking me through what a typical day looks like for you, from start to finish?"

By asking the person to walk you through their day, you're:

*   Giving them the opportunity to provide more information
*   Focusing the conversation on their actions and behavior rather than their words
*   Allowing yourself to gather more context and potentially identify inconsistencies in their story

This approach can help you gather more information without directly confronting the person about their dishonesty.
You could say something like, "I'd love to get a better understanding of your daily routine. Can you walk me through your typical day?"
You could say, "That sounds interesting, can you tell me more about your work?"
You could say, "I'm not an expert, can you explain it in more detail?"
You could say, "I'm not sure I understand the timeline, could you walk me through it again?"
